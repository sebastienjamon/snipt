Snipt - Code Snippets That Remember

Snipt: Teach Claude Code your workflow once, use forever

The first snippet manager built for AI coding assistants.
Snipt is a cloud-based code snippet manager that helps developers store, organize, and retrieve reusable code snippets—with a game-changing twist: Claude Code learns from your solutions and never makes the same mistake twice.
What Makes Snipt Different
While tools like Cacher and 3Cols simply store your snippets, Snipt creates institutional memory for your AI assistant. Through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration:

Self-improving AI: When Claude Code solves a problem after multiple attempts, it saves the solution automatically
Context-rich snippets: Not just code, but why it works, common mistakes to avoid, and prerequisites
Team knowledge compounds: Your entire team's learnings become Claude Code's knowledge base
First-try success: Claude searches your snippets before attempting commands, using proven solutions instead of trial-and-error

Core Features
✅ Smart snippet library - Store, tag, and search code across all languages
✅ MCP server integration - Claude Code reads from and writes to your snippet vault
✅ Version history - Track how snippets evolve over time
✅ Team workspaces - Share organizational knowledge across your team
✅ Rich context - Document prerequisites, common mistakes, and troubleshooting
✅ Fast search - Find the right snippet in milliseconds
Pricing
Developers already pay €5-8/month for effective snippet managers. Snipt offers more:

Free: 50 snippets, personal use
Pro (€7/month): Unlimited snippets, MCP access, AI learning
Team (€15/user/month): Shared workspaces, team knowledge base, analytics

The Market Opportunity
Snippet managers are proven tools with strong demand in 2024. Snipt captures this market while offering the first MCP-native solution—turning static snippet storage into an AI assistant that learns and improves with every use.
